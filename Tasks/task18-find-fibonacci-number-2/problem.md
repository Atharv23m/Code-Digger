## Find the Fibonacci

You are given t test cases.
And in each test case, you have 1 integers n.

You have to tell the n'th Fibonacci number.

The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:

F(0) = 0 , F(1) = 1 , Fn = F(n-1) + F(n-2).

i.e -> 0 1 1 2 3 5 ....  Fibonacci sequence.

Constraints:

1 <= t <=10

1 <= n <= 1e16


```
Input:
3
1
2
3
4

Output:
0
1
1
2


```
