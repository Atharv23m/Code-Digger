## Sanyam and Primes

Sanyam is a berozgaar and a [nalla](https://i.redd.it/70ur0veyu23a1.jpg); he has nothing to do so he plays with large numbers

One day, as he was subtracting numbers from their [prime](https://i.redd.it/gksawnbn0qs91.jpg) factors, he noticed that some numbers reached 0 faster than others.

As he's nalla he wont solve this promblem. He hands this problem to you.

You are given some numbers in `input.txt`, you need to output the minimum steps required to reduce the 'ith` number to 0.

Sample Input:
```
2
9
```

Sample Output:
```
1 (Subtract 2 from 2 as its prime)
2 (Subtract 3 from 9 -> 6 subtract 3 -> 3 subtract 3 -> 0)
```

#### Note:
You must code an efficient solution. It should run under `1.5s` on your local machine.
